A 3-year project funded by WWF and led by Imperial has just begun with the aim to increase knowledge on how krill and salps contribute to carbon (C) sequestration. Excitingly Anona Griffiths has joined the team as a Research Assistant to lead this work, having finished her Masters at Imperial in September 2022. You can read more about the project on the [Research](https://e-cavan.github.io/Research/) page.
