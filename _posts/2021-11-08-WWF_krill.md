WWF along with the help of some expert UK scientists made this [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km0GAPvQLBc&t=1s) showcasing the superhero qualities of Antarctic krill through their ability to sink carbon to the deep ocean in their faecal pellets. 

I had the opportunity to work with WWF and my krill colleagues on this animation, which was released at an event in the [WWF paviliion](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/climate_and_energy_practice/cop26/) at COP26.  

Animations like these are so important in teaching the public and politicians of the power of nature.
