This year I was awarded one of the [Challenger Society of Marine Science](https://www.challenger-society.org.uk/Home) fellowships, which celebrates 'excellence in marine science' and the careers of early-mid level researchers in the UK. It was an honour to receive the award and recognition, and even more exciting to receive it at the [Challenger Society's biennial conference](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/science-events/the-challenger-society-conference-2022-in-london.html), this year celebrating 150 years since HMS Challenger set sail to circumnavigate the globe to learn about the ocean depths. 

Thank you to those who nominated me and all of the many mentors and colleagues for their support over the past few years! And congratulations to the fellow 2022 awardees Anthony Birchill, Felipe Sales de Frietas and Alice Marzocchi!
