New paper out in [Global Change Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16019) identifying global hotspots of fishing intensity and the pelagic carbon sink. [Dr Simeon Hill](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/sih/) and I also explore the potential impacts fishing could be having on the carbon sink, from directly removing faecal pellet producing species, to causing trophic cascades negatively impacting low  trophic plankton important in sinking carbon to the deep ocean and sediments.

This paper contributes to a growing body of international research on the impact industrial fishing could be having on carbon sequestration.
