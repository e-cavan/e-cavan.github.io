This week in collaboration with  [OCB](https://https://www.us-ocb.org/) I co-chaired an online workshop to bring together experts on 1) the role of fish in the biological carbon pump, 2) the potential impact of fishing on oceanic carbon and 3) what the implications to society would be if fishing management changed to protect the biological pump. 


There were [three different sessions](https://www.us-ocb.org/fish-fisheries-and-carbon/) based on each topic, with over 100 participants per workshop. This was the first meeting to bring together scientists, policy makers and NGOs to discuss this important and rapidly developing topic. A workshop report with future directions will be available soon.
