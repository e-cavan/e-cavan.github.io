The NGO [Our Fish](https://our.fish/) delivered an online symposium [Delivering on Climate & Biodiversity Targets Through Better Fisheries Management](https://our.fish/news/symposium-delivering-on-climate-biodiversity-targets-through-better-fisheries-management/) in March 2021, to explore how ending overfishing can help realise biodiversity and climate change goals. The event was particuarly aimed at the EU, and was free and open for all to attend, including scientists, policy makers and the public. Emma was invited to speak on the second day of the event on how fishing could be disrupting the pelagic plankton carbon sink. The key points from Emma's talk were then relayed to the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans & Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevicius on the final day of the symposium.
