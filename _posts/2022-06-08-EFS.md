In June I got to spend a week in Plymouth teaching Imperial students about rocky shores, muddy estuaries and plankton! Biological Sciences undergraduate students at Imperial can choose to do a summer module in their second year called 'Ecological Field Skills' coordinated by my wonderful colleague Dr Emma Ransome. Thankfully the weather was kind to us, mostly, this year!
