I have recently been appointed to the [NERC Advisary Network](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/nerc/how-we-are-governed/boards-and-committees/nerc-advisory-network/), otherwise known as NAN! The network is formed of leading science users including academia, business and policy to provide strategic and policy advice to NERC. NERC is the Natural and Environmental Research Council responsible for funding environmental science in the UK.
