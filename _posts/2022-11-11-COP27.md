    caption: Panel event 'Fish are carbon engineers'
---

[Our Fish](https://our.fish/) held an event at COP27 this year in the [Ocean Pavilion](https://oceanpavilion-cop.org/schedule/) to discuss how [Fish are carbon engineers](https://our.fish/news/cop27-side-event-fish-are-carbon-engineers/) and the impact fisheries may be having on carbon storage.


I spoke on the panel along with Prof Hans-Otto Poertner and Bec Hubbard to discuss what we know about the role of fish and marine ecosystems in storing carbon, and how fisheries might be disrupting the carbon cycle. This is part of on-going research to investigate more about how we can protect fish stocks from over-fishing as well as the carbon cycle and the health of our planet.
