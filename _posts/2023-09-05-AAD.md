As part of our WWF project to increase knowledge on how krill and salps contribute to carbon sequestration, Research Assistant [Anona Griffiths](https://e-cavan.github.io/About/) headed off to Tasmania (Australia) to carry out experiments with, of course, krill poo! Anona spent 2-months at the [Australian Antarctic Division krill aquarium](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/antarctic-operations/webcams/krill/) experimenting on how krill poo, as well as krill dead bodies and exoskeletons, contribute to carbon sinks in the ocean.

The results will help feed into calculations of circumpolar carbon sinks by krill adults and larvae, as well as those of salps. You can read more about the project on the [Research](https://e-cavan.github.io/Research/) page.
