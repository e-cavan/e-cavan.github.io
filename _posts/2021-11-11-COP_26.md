This year got to attend my first COP (UN Climate Change summit), which was the [26th COP held in  Glasgow, UK](https://ukcop26.org/). I was able to attend the Blue Zone representing Imperial College, which is the area where the negotiations took place to write an agreed text to be passed by all UN delegations.

I also spoke at an [Our Fish event](https://our.fish/news/cop26-event-save-the-ocean-to-save-the-climate/) on how stopping over-fishing is climate action. This event was held elsewhere in Glasgow and lead to a thoughtful discussion on the implications of over-fishing on the environment and what is needed to prevent it. 

The [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop26-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-glasgow) has summarised the outcomes of the summit, including what the road to COP27 in Egypt looks like.
