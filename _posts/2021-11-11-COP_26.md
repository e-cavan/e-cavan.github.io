This year got to attend my first COP (UN Climate Change summit), which was the [26th COP held in  Glasgow, UK](https://ukcop26.org/). I was able to attend the Blue Zone representing Imperial College, which is the area where I the negotiations took place to write an agreed text to be passed by all UN delegations.

I also spoke at an [Our Fish event](https://our.fish/news/cop26-event-save-the-ocean-to-save-the-climate/) on how stopping over-fishing is climate action. This event was held elsewhere in Glasgow and lead to a thoughtful discussion on the implications of over-fishing on the environment and what is needed to prevent it. 

The [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop26-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-glasgow) has summarised the outcomes of the summit, including what the road to COP27 in Egypt looks like.
