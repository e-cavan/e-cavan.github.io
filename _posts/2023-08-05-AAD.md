As part of the WWF project funded by WWF to increase knowledge on how krill and salps contribute to carbon (C) sequestration, Research Assistant [Anona Griffiths](https://e-cavan.github.io/About/) headed off the Hobart, Tasmania, Australia to carry out experiments with, of course, krill poo! Anona spent 2-months at the [Australian Antarctic Division krill aquarium](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/antarctic-operations/webcams/krill/) to carry out new research on the how krill poo, as well as their dead bodies and exoskeletons, contribute to carbon sinks in the ocean.

The results will help feed into calculations of circumpolar carbon sinks by krill adults and larvae, as well as those of salps, as part of the WWF project. You can read more about the project on the [Research](https://e-cavan.github.io/Research/) page.
