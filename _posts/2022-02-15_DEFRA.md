For the first few months of 2022 I am seconded (on loan) from Imperial to DEFRA, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK government. This is an incredible opportunity where I can learn more about how UK policy is made and crucially how science is used as evidence in policy making. I have been seconded onto a specific project within DEFRA which is classified as 'Official Sensitive' and so the details cannot be shared.
