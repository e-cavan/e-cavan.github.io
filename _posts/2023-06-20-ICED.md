Emma is now a co-chair of [ICED](https://www.iced.ac.uk/index.htm), the international multidisciplinary program on 'Integrating Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean'. ICED is a regional group of [IMBeR](https://imber.info/), and works to coordinate Southern Ocean scientists to better understand climate interactions in the Southern Ocean, the implications for ecosystem dynamics, the impacts on biogeochemical cycles, and the development of sustainable management procedures. 

One of the major most recent outputs of ICED is contribution to MEASO (Marine
Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean), which has just released its first [Summary for Policy Makers](https://www.iced.ac.uk/documents/MEASO_Summary.pdf), 5-years after the first conference in Hobart, 2018.
