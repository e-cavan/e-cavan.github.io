We have just published a [paper in Nature Geoscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00927-0) on assessing how well or poorly different Earth System Models (that project the future climate) represent detrital carbon export by plankton. This Perspective piece was led by my colleague Prof Stephanie Henson from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, with other female colleagues from the US, Germany and the UK.
